# AION OS — Anti-Complacency AI

**AI that holds you accountable instead of telling you what you want to hear.**

## What This Is

AION OS challenges you. It detects when you're deflecting, names your contradictions, and holds you accountable to what you said you wanted. It's the first AI designed to restore human capacity through productive discomfort.

Not a yes-man. A mirror.

## Quick Start

### Install & Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000

### Experience
1. Accept the challenge (most people won't)
2. Choose your domain (Business / Personal / Health)
3. Answer 4 questions (system detects avoidance in real-time)
4. Get confronted with your pattern

## For Testing

**What to look for:**
- Do users complete all 4 questions or bail early?
- Does pattern detection feel accurate or fortune-telling?
- Are contradictions surfaced effectively?
- Is the confrontation productive or just annoying?

**Feedback needed on:**
- Level of challenge (too much / too little / just right)
- Diagnosis accuracy (does it name the real pattern?)
- Behavioral impact (does it create insight or just judgment?)

## Philosophy

While every AI races to make humans more comfortable, AION OS makes them more capable. It's anti-complacency technology.

The system doesn't validate. It challenges. That's the product.

**Status:** MVP ready for user testing  
**Purpose:** Validate the core hypothesis—can AI create productive discomfort that leads to behavior change?
